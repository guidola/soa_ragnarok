# FileSystem Interpreter 

This project designs and implements an application which allows to recognize and manipulate volumes formatted as:

* EXT2
* EXT3
* EXT4 
* FAT16
* FAT32

Both the recognition and manipulation process are both done through the analysis and interpretation of raw data following each file format specification.
